    <h2>Overview</h2>   
<p>The Work Readiness module has been an invaluable source of knowledge that served as a tool in my undersdanding of the workplace environment. 
  Understanding and evaluating what employment in my field of study entails and what moulds me into an asset for a workplace I would be progressing to venture into.
  From creating a career development plan to evaluating my career goals as a junior developer in the career ladder.

</p>
<br><br>
  <h2>CAREER COUNSELLING</h2>
  <strong>Situation:</strong><br>
  <p>
During my work-readiness training, I reached a stage where I needed to make clear decisions about the direction of my future career in Information Technology.
I was uncertain about which specific area to pursue and wanted to gain a better understanding of my strengths, values, and long-term goals. 
I realized that while I had technical knowledge from my studies, I needed structured guidance to align my personal aspirations with realistic career opportunities.
<br><br>
<strong>Task:</strong><br>
I embarked in a career counselling process that would help me identify suitable career paths, set SMART goals
 (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound), and develop an action plan to reach those goals.
 I aimed to create a personal career development plan that would act as a guide for me toward professional growth and fulfillment.

<br><br>
<strong>Action</strong><br>
I engaged actively in career counselling sessions where I reflected on my personal values, motivations, and skills. 
Through guided questions and assessments, I explored what success meant to me and what kind of work environment I wanted to be part of. 
I learned how to clarify my goals by asking myself what I wanted to achieve, this is the S-specific in (SMART Goals) in a span of five years,
 and how to identify the gaps between my current skills and those required for my desired career.
  this is the M-measurable in (SMART Goals).
 I also learned about the 70/20/10 Development Model — understanding that 70% of my learning would come from experience, 
20% from others, and 10% from formal education.
        <br><br>
<strong>Result</strong><br>
As a result, I developed a strong sense of self-awareness and direction.
I was able to create a structured career plan that focuses on continuous personal and professional growth.
I learned to set achievable milestones, seek mentorship, and take practical steps toward becoming a well-rounded IT professional. 
This process gave me confidence in my career choices and motivation to pursue my goals with determination.
  <br><br>
  <h2>SKILLS AND INTERESTS</h2>
  <strong>Situation</strong>
    <p>
I realized that understanding my skills and interests was essential in choosing a career that aligns with my personality and values. 
With that it is crucial to understand the specific field that I would be mainly focused in.
Before encountering the skills and interests module, I focused on what would be required of me at work , rather than what i am capable of doing being the pointer of what to seek in a workplace application. 
This made it challenging to find fulfillment in my academic projects or imagine myself in a specific IT career path.
<br><br>
<strong>Task:</strong><br>
My goal was to identify both my adaptive and transferable skills, as well as my personal interests that could influence my career direction. 
I needed to recognize what abilities and skills I have acquired and how they would be an asset in a workplace I would be seeking employment at.
 <br>
<strong>Action</strong><br>
I completed a self-assessment that involved reflecting on my achievements, education, 
and work experiences to determine where my strengths lie. I analyzed moments where I felt most 
engaged — whether solving coding challenges, collaborating in group projects, or creating innovative designs.
I also explored my core values such as creativity, problem-solving, and helping others. Through this reflection,
I identified which of the six vocational interest categories (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, 
and Conventional) I related to most.I distinguished that from the different modules at school I have acquired invaluable skills to my possession, 
skills being expertise in the programming languages namely being java, javascript, python, blockchain, SQL. These together were helpful when 
creating my CV as I could emphasize my knowledge and interest in these areas.
<br><br>
<strong>Result</strong><br>
This process helped me discover that I am most satisfied when working on projects that 
combine analytical thinking with teamwork. I gained clarity on which roles in IT would
suit me best — such as systems analysis or application development spcifically front end bassed development. Understanding my 
skills and interests not only guided me to my desired career field but also allowed me to focus 
on career paths that will ensure long-term fulfillment and growth.


<br><br>
  <h2>PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT</h2>
  <strong>Situation:</strong><br>
  <p>
Upon completing the personality assessment, I had to assess how my personality
 influenced my performance and satisfaction in different environments and fileds.
 This was to assess how my esponse to these environments affects my personality and where it thrives and best suited.
<br><br>
<strong>Task:</strong><br>
I wanted to assess my personality to gain insight into my natural traits, preferences, and behaviors, and to see how they aligned with potential IT careers. 
My goal was to identify a career path that complements my personality so that I could work in environments where I could thrive and perform at my best.

<br><br>
<strong>Action</strong><br>

I took part in a personality assessment that categorized different personality types such as
 Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. Through this exercise,
  I evaluated what energizes me and what kind of work environment I prefer. The results showed that
   I possess strong Social and Investigative tendencies — meaning that I lean more towards problem solving, 
   continuos knowledgeability ,collaborating and engaging with other team members.
 This helped me understand that I value teamwork, meaningful communication, and opportunities for continuous learning.<br>

<br><br>
<strong>Result</strong><br>
After completing the assessment, I gained a much deeper understanding of 
how my personality influences my work habits and relationships. I learned 
that I am most productive in environments that encourage collaboration,
problem-solving, and creativity. This knowledge empowered me to choose career
paths that align with my natural strengths and personality traits,
increasing my expertise and sense of direction in my desired IT field.
  <br><br>
  <h2>CREATING A CV</h2>
  <strong>Situation:</strong><br>
  <p>

Prior to this learning experience , I had a CV but I came to realise that it was not fit for applying for internships and job opportunities, I realized that I needed
 a professional CV that would accurately represent my qualifications,
 experience, and career goals.This is because my CV lacked structure and failed
  to highlight my unique strengths effectively.
<br><br>
<strong>Task:</strong><br>
My goal was to edit and redesign my CV, clearly reflecting my educational history and education in the field of work I am leaning towards.This would entail my
 technical skills, achievements, interests and personal qualities. I wanted to create a CV that would not 
only meet the standards in the specific job application but also serve as a personal marketing tool for extra curricular work 
like freelance work developing websites for people etc.
<br><br>
<strong>Action:</strong><br>
I studied the guidelines provided in the “Create a CV” module,
 learning that a CV should be structured, easy to scan, 
 and tailored to the position I’m applying for. I organized my information into sections 
 — including personal details, education, work experience, technical skills, and references. I followed the five formatting rules: creating structure, ensuring consistency, using bullet points, highlighting key achievements with action verbs, and keeping information relevant. 
I also applied the concept of writing with a professional tone.<br>


<br><br>

<strong>Result</strong><br>

Through this process, I created a polished and professional CV that communicates my abilities clearly and efficiently. 
It reflects both my technical and interpersonal skills, making it suitable for my internship application cor Work Integrated learning. Most importantly, 
this module taught me how to present myself effectively to employers and gave me a stronger sense of professional identity.
